            Modern web development requires flexibility and adaptability to incorporate the latest
            technology so that businesses can gain an advantage and leap over the competition.
            At the same time, new technology needs to be battle-tested and proven before they can
            be trusted. Balancing the competitive needs of a business with the technical hurdles
            of development is the key to success for both the business and the developer. Having a
            prior career in real estate gives me a deep understanding of the business world, and combining
            it with web development enables me to be a highly productive fit into any team.

            Having spent many years working directly with clients, I always felt humbled that they
            would entrust their needs to me. Knowing that if I failed, I would be solely responsible
            for setting them back and causing great harm. Shouldering this responsibility made me 
            very driven to move mountains if necessary to achieve the goal 
            and not let down the people who depend on me.

            A cohesive team is more productive than one that is not. However, everyone has different personalities
            and communication styles which may prevent team cohesion. I help bridge that gap
            by connecting with my team on an individual level to build trust and find ways to supplement behavioral differences between team members.
            Having worked with a variety of clients and vendors from all walks of life,
            I can identify relationship issues to bring improvements to the team dynamic and increase productivity.

            The workplace is where your reputation resides. This is where the world can see you.
            As such, it is important to show the best of yourself and constantly seek to improve further.
            I believe one's behavior and actions are a reflection of the company, especially in the eyes of the customer.
            Therefore it is critical to always show the best version of yourself. Eventually the best version
            of yourself becomes who you really are.
